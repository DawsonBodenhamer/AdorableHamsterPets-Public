# <font color="orange">The most sophisticated pet mod you've ever seen.</font>

That's a bold claim, so allow me to demonstrate. **Adorable Hamster Pets** stuffs Minecraft with pint-sized, jiggly fur-missiles that have a craving for... diamonds. Perfect for anyone who surveys their diamond-encrusted empire and mutters, “Needs more rodents.” These hamsters like to bounce, shoulder-surf, hoard snacks, sniff for things, and moonlight as throwable projectiles, all while adding maximum charm and helping with your inventory clutter. Tame, feed, or yeet at will; (ethics optional).

## <font color="teal">The Basics— but tier 100 Cuteness</font>

- **Taming & Sitting**
  - Bribe them with enough Sliced Cucumber, and they'll follow you like a furry, ankle-biting shadow. Right-click to make them sit, lest they develop a sudden fascination with the nearest lava pool. Again. (Jk I actually coded them to be terrified of lava and water)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/EEZeH79.gif" alt="A hamster begging for sliced cucumber" width="48%">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/z8Ob8Fy.gif" alt="A hamster sitting due to player interaction" width="48%">
</p>

- **Advanced Napping Protocols**
  - Tamed hamsters, when left sitting, might just decide it's naptime. Watch as they gradually drift off through an elaborate "Path to Slumber" sequence, complete with unique animations for dozing, settling, and several adorable deep sleep poses. This dedication to slumber is, of course, configurable. 

- **Unique Animation Personalities**
  - Not all hamsters are created equal. Upon birth, each hamster is assigned one of three "personalities," which determines the specific sitting and dozing off animations it will use for its entire life. One might be a prim and proper sitter, while another is a bit more of a sloucher. It's a small touch to make your specific furry companion feel even more unique.

- ### I have many more plans for more QOL features like these! 👆🏼👆🏼

## <font color="teal">Shoulder Surfing— with *Perks*</font>

Lure up to three of your tamed hamsters onto your person with the irresistible siren call of Cheese. They'll offer helpful alerts about nearby threats and possibly valuable shiny rocks. They're smart enough to find the next available perch—one for each shoulder, and yes, one for your head.

These aren't static decorations; they're fully animated, living shoulder buddies. Thanks to a custom physics simulation, they'll bounce realistically when you jump, float slightly when you fall, and satisfyingly squash back onto your shoulder when you land, complete with unique sound effects. They'll even hunker down and hold on for dear life when you sprint.

They're also polite enough to make room for your gear, automatically shifting their position to sit neatly on top of your chestplate instead of clipping through it.

## <font color="teal">The Hamster Yeet™</font>

For when words fail and you need a furry, surprisingly aerodynamic solution— press **'G'** (by default - check your keybinds if you're just flailing your arms) while *not* staring intently at a block. Behold as your shoulder companion becomes a surprisingly effective, albeit concussed, projectile. Includes satisfying particle trail, impact sound effects, and flight sounds that change pitch as it flies— the [**Doppler Effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect)!

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/nLZUyfR.gif" alt="The Hamster Yeet part 1" width="48%">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NcxEZjz.gif" alt="The Hamster Yeet part 2" width="48%">
</p>

Does enough damage by default to kill a creeper, which is... really convenient. Gentle interaction (a pat, a click, whatever) required for post-impact recovery.

## <font color="teal">Hamster Kung Fu Techniques</font>

They'll energetically implement hamster kung fu on enemies (yours or theirs). Essentially, they like round-house kicks. Complete with particles effects on their tiny kicking feet!

## <font color="teal">Tamed Wander Mode & Hamster Beds</font>

Tired of your hamsters treating your feet like a personal jungle gym?

Craft a **Hamster Bed** (available in all vanilla wood flavors, because aesthetics) from some wood planks and **Hamster Bedding**. **Right-click** your tamed hamster with the bed to link them, then place the bed in the world. Boom. Your hamster is now a free-range rodent, happily wandering within a set radius of its new home base.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BZlWLk8.jpeg" alt="A hamster sleeping in its linked bed." width="48%">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rsq7MJB.jpeg" alt="A hamster sitting near its linked bed." width="48%">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wSuzX0F.jpeg" alt="A hamster sitting near its linked bed." width="96%">
</p>

Need to adjust the settings? Interact with the bed:
*   **Right-click:** Toggles Wander Mode on/off. For when you need a break from the constant, ankle adoration.
*   **Sneak + Right-click:** Cycles through the wander distance (Near, Medium, Far). All configurable, of course.
*   **Right-click with Cheese:** Lures your hamster to its bed for a nap. Useful for when you need it to stay put for a while.
*   **Right-click with Rotten Flesh:** Applies a 'rodent repellent' effect, making the bed smell vaguely of despair.
*   **Sneak + Right-click with Rotten Flesh:** Unlinks the bed entirely. A divorce, but without the tragedy.

By default, your now-independent hamster will dutifully toddle off to its bed for a nap during the day. Or night, if you set it in the config. Should you find this routine too predictable, you can dive into said config and enable **"Circadian Chaos"** for a more... 'whenever-it-feels-like-it' napping schedule.

P.S. - Don't place the bed upside down. Just don't do it.

## <font color="teal">Furry Diamond Prospecting</font>

So, your shoulder-mounted furball just made a series of excited squeaks and sniffs, hinting at nearby diamonds? Excellent. Now for the fun part. Dismount your tiny prospector. If it was indeed onto something shiny, it might just take matters into its own feet.

Watch as it attempts to lead you to the alleged riches, complete with sniffing animations, determined dust-sniffing particles (the particle colors match the ground below, because details💅🏼), and a soundtrack of focused sniffs.

If its path is blocked, it'll wait patiently (or impatiently, it's hard to tell), hoping you'll clear the way. Upon reaching its target, it'll celebrate with cool particle effects and a chorus of happy bounces (with sound!).

But be warned: sometimes, in their eagerness, these little geologists might get a tad confused about what exactly constitutes a "valuable shiny rock." If it unearths something... less diamond-y and more... not-quite-diamond-ish... prepare for a dramatic sulk, complete with its own unique animation, sound effects, and a display of utter disappointment. A quick pat should snap it out of its angst.

This whole ore-seeking escapade is, of course, configurable.

![Diamond Sniffing](https://i.imgur.com/mF7L8ph.jpeg)

## <font color="teal">Item Stealing & The Game of Tag</font>

Your hamster's love for shiny things may have evolved into full-blown kleptomania. If you carelessly leave valuable items (like, say, diamonds) on the ground, your tamed companion might just decide it's time for a game.

Watch as it executes a flawless pounce, snatches the item right off the ground, and takes off! The stolen treasure will be visibly held in its mouth as it initiates a chase sequence. Get too close, and it will sprint away. Fall too far behind, and it will stop and taunt you with a playful animation. Be warned. I almost died of cuteness overload while creating it.

The only way to retrieve your property is to catch the furry thief and right-click it. But be warned—if you take too long, it might get bored and drop the item. But then it might steal it again. This entire feature is fully configurable of course— from which items are considered "valuable" (defaults to just diamonds) to the duration of the chase.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/05ELSu7.gif" alt="Item Stealing" width="48%">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8bRKwsC.gif" alt="Item Stealing" width="48%">
</p>

## <font color="teal">Biome Variants & Genetics</font>

Got a heavily modded world? Good news— my spawning system is set up to be incredibly compatible with world-gen mods like Terralith and Biomes O' Plenty right out of the box. Don't like the defaults? Fine. The system is also fully configurable, allowing you to define exactly where hamsters and plants should (or shouldn't) appear using biome IDs and a wide range of biome tags. Your world, your rules.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/344No2v.gif" alt="A sample of four different hamster colors" width="34%">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4Y8wnus.gif" alt="player interacting with baby hamster GIF" width="60%">
</p>

Now, for the default zoology lesson. With **9 base coats** and **8 overlay patterns** (plus the unique White color), there are a staggering **73 possible hamster variants** to discover. (With plans for many more!)

Hamsters found shivering in snowy plains look different from those basking in deserts. Shocking, I know. They even pass these diverse palettes on to their offspring, with a polite attempt to not *exactly* copy their parents' overlay patterns, ensuring maximum genetic *variety* in your ever-growing population.

### <font color="teal">A Field Guide to Hamster Habitats</font>
<details>

*   **Orange & Cream:** The most common type, often found sunning themselves in Plains, Savannas, Deserts, and non-frigid Beaches. Badlands also seem to attract the Orange ones.
*   **Chocolate:** Prefers the shaded canopy of Forests and non-snowy Taigas (excluding Cherry Groves, those are special).
*   **Black:** Enjoys the damp ambiance of wet biomes like swamps and the mysterious depths of the Deep Dark.
*   **Light Gray & Dark Gray:** These stoic shades are common in non-frozen mountainous regions and also share cave real estate with their Black brethren.
*   **White:** Exclusively found in most snowy biomes (Plains, Taiga, Groves, etc.) and makes up about 30% of the population in the extremely chilly Ice Spikes.
*   **Blue:** A master of glacial camouflage. This rare variant's cool, blue-tinted fur is an uncanny match for the shimmering ice and packed snow of the most frigid landscapes. While vary rare in the default game, (only spawns in Ice Spikes), its love for ice means it might also be spotted in other crystalline wonderlands added by mods.
*   **Lavender:** Less about survival and more about style, this variant's dusty purple coat is a perfect match for the fantastical flora of magical biomes. Look for them amidst the pink petals of Cherry Groves and the strange hues of Mushroom Fields. Their preference for the peculiar means you might also find them in other enchanted forests or mystical groves added by mods.

</details>

## <font color="teal">New Questionable Flora</font>

*   **Wild Cucumber Bushes:** These crunchy snacks prefer a tan. By default, you'll find them lurking in **Plains, Savannas, Forests, and Jungles**. Basically, if it’s warm and dry-ish, there’s probably a cucumber waiting to be found. Right-click the seeded ones for seeds. If you are living in a modded world with totally weird biomes, you can fully customize their spawning in the config, geography be hanged.
<p align="center">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wam5Vqt.jpeg" alt="Wild Cucumber Bush" width="48%">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9pwc5hk.jpeg" alt="Cucumber Crop" width="48%">
</p>

* **Wild Green Bean Bushes:** Legumes that thrive on moisture. They spawn in **Swamps, Mangrove Swamps, Lush Caves, and Flower Forests**. If your boots are soggy, you're probably close. Of course you can also override these spawn locations in the config and put them anywhere, even modded biomes.
<p align="center">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7TfzYj5.jpeg" alt="Wild Green Bean Bush" width="48%">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wo4fzuK.jpeg" alt="Green Bean Crop" width="48%">
</p>

*   **Slightly Less Useless Sunflowers:** Vanilla sunflowers merely exist; mine *produce*. Right-click the head when seeded for **Sunflower Seeds**. They spawn naturally in **Sunflower Plains** (shocking, I know) and will automatically replace vanilla sunflowers in compatible modded biomes tagged as `c:is_plains/temperate/hot/dry`. They regrow seeds eventually. Patience is a virtue. Isn't that right, John?
    * Keep in mind that while these are configurable, they only replace vanilla sunflowers . They won't spawn on their own, so if there was not going to be a sunflower there to begin with, telling mine to spawn there isn't going to do anything.

## <font color="teal">Exciting New Foodstuffs</font>

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/VUrQDWD.png" alt="Items: cucumber, sliced cucumber, green beans, steamed green beans, hamster food mix, cheese" width="400">

*   **Cucumber/Green Beans:** Grow 'em, eat 'em raw (if you must), slice 'em, steam 'em. Culinary possibilities are… present. Wild hamsters go nuts for these.
*   **Steamed Green Beans:** A suspiciously potent super-food for your hamster. Grants temporary buffs, followed by a mandatory "please wait" period. Don't get greedy.
*   **Hamster Food Mix:** Allegedly gourmet. Heals well, bypasses their irritating pickiness, and is the key to unlocking their cheek pouches. Craft it. Or don't. Your hamster, your problem.
*   **Cheese:** Not only can it lure hamsters onto your shoulder, it's player-edible. Surprisingly nutritious (think cooked porkchop levels) and you can scarf it down about 30% faster than most foods. The only catch? The... *distinctively moist* eating sound. Consider it an acquired taste. Its nutritional value is fully configurable, for those of you who felt cheese was somehow "unbalanced." Plebs.

## <font color="teal">Steamed Green Bean Zoomies</font>

My wife's IRL hamster (Sweet Potato) goes nuts for steamed green beans, which of course inspired this feature. Feed your hamster Steamed Green Beans, and it will enter a state of pure, unadulterated zoomies.

It's not just faster— it will also gain icreased **Strength, Absorption, and Regeneration,** and instead of standing around idly, it will engage in sporadic, high-speed chaotic sprints in circles around you, leaving a trail of energetic particles in its wake. And when it comes to following you, they no longer go in a straight line— it's more of a "hyperactive escort mission."


<p align="center">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/apzETeW.gif" alt="Green Bean Zoomies" width="48%">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/apzETeW.gif" alt="Green Bean Zoomies" width="48%">
</p>

## <font color="teal">Cheek Pouches of Holding</font>

Yes, inventory... *in their face*. Feed them **Hamster Food Mix** once to earn their trust (and cheek access!), then Sneak + Right-click a tamed hamster for 6 slots of prime real estate. No, you can't stuff a Netherite block in there. They'll even automatically scarf down **Hamster Food Mix** from their cheeks if they take a tumble, after a brief, dramatic pause to consider their options. Can't make them *too* overpowered.

## <font color="teal">Spider/Ravager Psychological Warfare</font>

**Ravagers** and **Spiders** are utterly terrified of hamsters. The sight of a tiny ball of fluff will send these menaces fleeing in the opposite direction. Why? Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to. This behavior is, of course, fully configurable if you feel the local monster population isn't suffering enough existential dread.

## <font color="teal">Artisanal Floor Mulch (Hamster Bedding)</font>

This humble pile of leaves and twigs, officially known as **Hamster Bedding**, is the cornerstone of hamster interior design. You'll need it to craft the aforementioned **Hamster Beds**.

But its true calling? Unnecessary ambiance. **Right-click** the item in the air—or put it in a **Dispenser**—to unleash a glorious poof of decorative leaf particles.

These aren't just any particles. Oh no. I've blessed them with a ridiculously over-engineered client-side physics simulation. They float with a gentle pendulum sway, react to a universal wind drift that slowly changes direction over a three-minute cycle, (or stays static if you toggle it) and are subject to "spatially-coherent wind gusts"—a fancy way of saying they all realistically blow in the same direction at the same time.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8nINkWN.gif" alt="Leaf Particle Physics" width="100%">
</p>

I even created an "indoors/outdoors" detection algorithm so the system is even smart enough to know when it's indoors, regardless of how you built your house or what materials you used. This system disables the wind effects indoors so you don't get a sudden gust of wind in your hobbit hole. You already have enough going on in there.

It's deeply unnecessary, and I'm incredibly satisfied with it.

P.S. - Remember, don't place your hamster bed upside down. Don't even think about it.

### <font color="teal">Future Plans</font>
*   Dark fur patches
*   Additional model shapes and sizes (shoulder mounting needs to be considered)
*   Join **[The Cheek Pouch](https://discord.gg/w54mk5bqdf)** Discord server if you have your own ideas! I'm all ears.

## <font color="teal">Custom Hamster Accessories</font>

Found some **Pink Petals**? Right-click your tamed hamster to bestow upon it a stylish floral accessory. Not feeling that particular look? Click again with petals to cycle through a few options. Regret your decision entirely? A quick snip with **Shears** will undo your fashionable folly (and you even get the petal back, because I'm nice like that).

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/2BLTcMY.png" alt="Pink Petal Accessory" width="400">


### <font color="teal">Future Plans</font>

The current accessory collection is... sparse, but the hamster haberdashery is just getting started. I mean the mod is still in beta after all. Lol. My Discord community suggestion box is overflowing with ideas that range from "brilliant" to "medically concerning," so future updates might just include some of the following questionable adornments:

*   **Adventuring Gear:** For the hamster with heroic delusions. Think tiny swords, shields, armadillo armor, and even a dried kelp eye-patch.
*   **Fruit-Themed Headwear:** Because who doesn't want a hamster wearing a tiny banana?
*   **More Flower Decoration Types:** We've already got pink petals, but we need ALL THE COLORS.
*   **Hats and Crowns:** Flower crowns for when your hamster needs to feel like the tiny, unelected monarch of the forest floor, and top hats for absolute sophistication.
*   **And much, much more...**

These are subject to change! Got a genius idea for the next hamster accessory that absolutely needs to exist? Think you've designed the perfect tiny helmet? Bring your brilliant, weird, and wonderful ideas to **[The Cheek Pouch](https://discord.gg/w54mk5bqdf)** Discord Server. Make sure you select **"Share Your Genius"** in the screening questions to get the `@Idea Generator` role, and then unleash your creativity in the suggestions channel.

## <font color="teal">The Hamster Tips Guide Book</font>

You get one automatically the first time you join a world (unless you turned that off in the config, you rebel). It contains *hints*. Read it. Or use it as kindling. See if I care. Lost it? Craft another with a Book and some Sliced Cucumber. Don't ask why Sliced Cucumber. It's a long story.

---

## <font color="teal">Getting Started (The "Bla Bla How Do I Make It Squeak?" Guide)</font>

1.  **Go Outside:** Wander aimlessly through Plains, Savannas, Forests, Swamps, etc., until you trip over **Wild Cucumber Bushes** or **Wild Green Bean Bushes**. Right-click the ones that look like they have seeds. Collect said seeds.
2.  **Pretend to Farm:** Plant seeds on farmland. Wait. Harvest. Try not to starve while waiting for virtual vegetables.
3.  **Questionable Crafting:** Turn Cucumbers into **Sliced Cucumber** (the bait). Turn Green Beans into **Steamed Green Beans** via furnace (for buffs). Cobble together various seeds and carrots into **Hamster Food Mix** (for healing). Turn Milk into **Cheese** (the Shoulder Shenanigans starter kit). Refer to your recipe book, I'm not writing recipes here.
4.  **Attempt Taming:** Find a wild hamster. **Sneak**. Hold **Sliced Cucumber**. Approach like you're diffusing a tiny, furry bomb. Click. Repeat until successful or rage-quit.
5.  **Basic Hamster Operations:** Right-click to sit/stand. Sneak + Right-click for cheek inventory access (after feeding Food Mix!). Wave Cheese around to shoulder-mount. By default, you crouch to dismount, or Press 'G' to dismount... *rapidly*. However, the whole dismounting process is highly configurable. You can choose between a single or double tap, and also set a custom keybind if you like.

## <font color="teal">How to Contact Me</font>

Alright, let's be real. Sometimes things break. Sometimes hamsters exhibit behavior that even *I* can't explain (looking at you, hamster #37, who tried to eat a sign). And sometimes you, my friend, might have a stroke of genius that could elevate this mod from "questionably charming" to "quite good."

Whether it's your genius ideas, or my not-so-genius mistakes, please tell me all about it! Knowing about either one just makes the mod all that much better. Here's how to get in touch.

*   **[The Cheek Pouch](https://discord.gg/w54mk5bqdf)** (official Discord server): This is the best place for bug reports and feature suggestions. Come hang out, share pictures of your hamsters, or get help in real-time. It's organized chaos, and you're invited.
*   **[GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/DawsonBodenhamer/AdorableHamsterPets-Public/issues):** If you're allergic to Discord, there's this. I do check it, but not very often.

## <font color="teal">Bug Reporting Etiquette (Please, I Beg You):</font>

If you're reporting a bug, to save both our sanities, try to include:

1.  **What You Were Doing:** (e.g., "I was trying to teach my hamster to yodel while riding a pig backwards during a thunderstorm...")
2.  **What You Expected to Happen:** (e.g., "...and I expected it to hit a high C, or at least not phase through the floor.")
3.  **What Actually Happened:** (e.g., "...but instead, it turned into a turnip and started quoting Shakespeare. Also, my game crashed.")
4.  **Minecraft Version, Mod Version, Fabric Loader/API Versions:** Usually found in the top of your crash report or your mod list.
5.  **Crash Report (If Applicable):** Use a site like [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/), [Gist](https://gist.github.com/), or [Mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs/) and give me the link. **Do NOT paste the whole thing into a GitHub comment or email.** My scroll wheel will thank you.
6.  **Pro Tip (For Crash Reports):** To make your life (and mine) infinitely easier, consider installing the [**Crash Assistant**](https://modrinth.com/mod/crash-assistant) mod. It's a client-side utility that pops up after a crash and gives you a one-click button to upload all relevant logs. It's not required, but it's *highly* recommended.
7.  **Screenshots/Videos (If Helpful):** A picture (or better yet, a screen recording) is worth a thousand lines of confused log reading.
8.  ### **👉🏼👉🏼👉🏼 Hamster Debug Info (Jade Mod):**
    *   If you have the [**Jade mod**](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade) installed, my mod includes a special debug overlay for hamsters.
    *   **To toggle this overlay:** Sneak and Right-Click a **tamed** hamster while holding the **Hamster Guide Book**. *(You can craft the guidebook with a Book + Sliced Cucumber).* An action bar message will confirm if it's enabled or disabled.
    *   Alternatively, you can enable/disable it in the "Adorable Hamster Pets" config screen (Mod Menu -> Adorable Hamster Pets -> UI & Quality of Life -> "Enable Jade Hamster Debug Info").
    *   If your bug involves hamster behavior or animations, please try to capture a screenshot or video with this debug overlay visible while looking at the affected hamster. Knowing the states shown in this overlay (e.g., "Current Custom Goal," "Sitting," "Dozing Phase") is extremely helpful for diagnosing issues!

The more info you give, the less I have to guess, and the faster things might get fixed.

Fun fact: I've already implemented new features like the custom advancement tree and config toggles for the hamster guidebook based on suggestions from my GitHub! We move quick around here.

## <font color="teal">Dependencies</font>

### For Fabric & Quilt:
*   **Fabric API:** The big one. The whole show.
*   **Architectury API:** The universal translator that makes this all possible.
*   **GeckoLib:** For the wiggles and jiggles. Essential.
*   **Patchouli:** Powers the gorgeous Hamster Tips guidebook.
*   **Fzzy Config:** For the config screen you'll either ignore or spend way too much time in.
*   **Fabric Language Kotlin:** Fabric's preferred brand of Kotlin, needed by Fzzy Config.

### For NeoForge & Forge:
*   **Architectury API:** The universal translator that makes this all possible.
*   **GeckoLib:** For the wiggles and jiggles. Essential.
*   **Patchouli:** Powers the gorgeous Hamster Tips guidebook.
*   **Fzzy Config:** For the config screen you'll either ignore or spend way too much time in.
*   **Kotlin for Forge:** NeoForge's flavor of Kotlin, also needed by Fzzy Config.

### Optional (but Recommended for Your Sanity):
*   **Jade** (Fabric/Quilt/NeoForge/Forge): I've integrated with Jade so you can see cool info.
*   **Mod Menu** (Fabric Only): For an easy way to get to that fancy config screen.

## <font color="teal">Loader & Version Support</font>

The dark days of unofficial workarounds and digital duct tape are ancient history. As of version 2.3.0, this mod officially supports:
*   **Fabric**
*   **Quilt**
*   **NeoForge**
*   **Forge**

Thanks to a basically heroic, caffeine-fueled refactor to the Architectury toolchain, you can now download the appropriate JAR for your loader of choice and enjoy hamster-based chaos without any extra setup.

Actually just kidding about the heroic caffeine-fueled part. It was more like terrified, GitHub conversation-fueled. Huge thanks to [**@fzzyhmstrs**](https://github.com/fzzyhmstrs) on GitHub / @ZeMonkey / @Cool Girl on Discord for all their help. It's doubtful you would be yeeting your hamsters on NeoForge right now if it weren't for them.

### **"What About More Minecraft Versions?"**
Yes, that's the plan. Once I get the mod out of beta, the goal is to keep it updated for the latest versions of Minecraft while continuing to support 1.20.1. Your hamster army's temporal conquest is inevitable. I do have quite a few more features I want to add before the full release though, so don't hold your breath. Definitely join **[The Cheek Pouch](https://discord.gg/w54mk5bqdf)** Discord server to keep up with progress!

## <font color="teal">Installation</font>

1.  Install Fabric Loader if you haven't already.
2.  Install Fabric API, Geckolib.
3.  Download the Adorable Hamster Pets `.jar` file. From where you got *this* file, presumably.
4.  Shove the `.jar` file into your `mods` folder. If you don't know where that is, maybe modding isn't for you.
5.  Launch Minecraft. Brace yourself.
6.  Briefly question the series of events that led you to installing a mod primarily focused on hamsters.



## <font color="teal">Configuration & Mod Compatibilities</font>

Uses [**Fzzy Config**](https://modrinth.com/mod/fzzy-config) for configuration. If you have Mod Menu, click the button. If not, venture into the `config/adorablehamsterpets` folder and edit `main.toml` by hand like some kind of digital caveman.

### <font color="teal">Out-of-the-Box Harmony</font>
I've already done the legwork to make this play nice with the big names. Hamster spawning is pre-tuned for gorgeous world-gen mods like [**Terralith**](https://modrinth.com/mod/terralith), so your lavender hamsters will actually show up in lavender fields, but It also works with massive mods like [**Oh The Biomes You'll Go**](https://modrinth.com/mod/biomesyougo) and [**Biomes O' Plenty**](https://modrinth.com/mod/biomes-o-plenty), though expect to see a lot of the common orange variant until I've had enough coffee to map out their 8,000+ biomes. (As of version 3.4.0, you can now do this yourself! Check `Config > Hamster Spawn Settings > Variant Spawning by Biome`)

Wild bushes and sunflowers should pop up just fine in any modded landscape, but if you run into issues, you can tweak the settings: `Config > Worldgen: Bush & Sunflower Stuff`.

Thanks to some glorious assistance from [**@CasualAnimalEnjoyer**](https://github.com/CasualAnimalEnjoyer), this mod is also compatible with [**Farmer's Delight**](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight), [**Cultural Delights**](https://modrinth.com/mod/cultural-delights), [**Croptopia**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/croptopia), and [**Serene Seasons**](https://modrinth.com/mod/serene-seasons/versions) by default!

### <font color="teal">Total Control Over Rodent Shenanigans</font>
For the advanced user who looks at a perfectly functional system and thinks, "I can make this weirder," the config file is your chaotic playground. There are no hard-coded hamster interaction items— everything can be modified. 
*   **Redefine their diet.** This mod includes built-in compatibility with [**Farmer's Delight**](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight) and its addon, [**Cultural Delights**](https://modrinth.com/mod/cultural-delights). But why stop there? Make them demand Nether Stars for taming. Make them steal only dirt blocks. Whatever. Live your truth.
*   **Fine-tune the physics.** Adjust the velocity, damage, and cooldown of the Hamster Yeet. Tweak the potency of the Green Bean zoomies.
*   **Become a cheese tycoon, or nerf it into the ground.** The nutritional value of cheese is fully configurable and even syncs with [**AppleSkin**](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin)'s HUD on Minecraft 1.21.1 (older versions are out of luck due to API shenanigans).

### <font color="teal">Immersion, Because I'm Fancy Like That</font>
Don't like that your hamsters can be mounted with cheese so you changed it to diamonds in the config? Good news—the sound effects and particle systems are smart enough to keep up. When you mount your hamster, it won't make a "squish" sound anymore; it'll make a satisfying "clink" and sparkle with diamond particles. This dynamic system applies to several interactions, ensuring the audio and visual feedback always matches your custom configuration. Because details. 💅🏼 (Even works with custom modded items!)

Thanks to the magic of Fzzy Config, all these settings are validated and synced from the server. That means *you* set the rules. Whatever you decide the taming difficulty, hamster damage, or acceptable cheese nutrition levels are, your players will abide by it. They can't change these core settings locally unless you give them the keys to the kingdom. A few purely cosmetic client-side settings are the exception, but the important stuff? That's all you.

## <font color="teal">Future Plans (The Ever-Expanding Hamster Agenda)</font>

The hamster wheel of "progress" never truly stops. Here's a peek at what might be scurrying out of the development pipeline, eventually:

*   ✅ <font color="green">**DONE**</font> | **Shoulder Sync with Animation Mods:** Investigating better visual integration of the shoulder hamster when using player animation overhaul resource packs like [**Fresh Animations**](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/fresh-animations). This is complex and depends on external factors.
*   ❌ <font color="red">**PENDING**</font> | **Version Voracity:** My hamsters aim to colonize more Minecraft versions, but I have quite a few more features I want to add before official release— only then will I begin to port to other versions.
*   ❌ <font color="red">**PENDING**</font> | **The Art of Cheese:** The current milk-to-cheese recipe is placeholder. Expect a more involved, thematically appropriate cheese-making process in the future.
*   ❌ <font color="red">**PENDING**</font> | **More Hamster Skins:** Expanding the variety of overlay patterns for even more unique-looking companions.
*   ❌ <font color="red">**PENDING**</font> | **The "Snack of Yestermouth":** A peculiar item formed when multiple food types are left in a hamster's cheek pouch for an extended period (accelerated by rotten flesh). Its purpose? Still under... *fermentation*. It will likely serve a unique, helpful, if slightly gross, function.
*   ❌ <font color="red">**PENDING**</font> | **So. Many. More. Ideas.:** The Discord server is overflowing with ideas. Lots of future plans in store!

Got a genius idea for the next feature that absolutely needs to exist? Bring your brilliant, weird, and wonderful ideas to **[The Cheek Pouch](https://discord.gg/w54mk5bqdf)** Discord Server. Make sure you select **"Share Your Genius"** in the screening questions to get the `@Idea Generator` role, and then unleash your creativity in the suggestions channel.

## <font color="teal">License (The Legal Blah Blah - But Actually Read This Bit)</font>

The license for this project is **All Rights Reserved.** © 2025 Dawson Bodenhamer ([**www.ForTheKing.Design**](https://www.fortheking.design/)).

### **What this License Covers**

The whole enchilada— all the Java code, the hamster models, their fur textures, the animations, every custom sound effect, the block/item textures, and even the build scripts. Basically, everything in this repository.

### **What that Means**

You can enjoy the mod, show it off in your videos (please do, and a little credit is always nice!), and include it in modpacks. However, you cannot copy, modify, redistribute, or use any part of this project (code or assets) in your own projects without explicit, prior, written permission. Think of it as an art gallery – admire, enjoy, don't walk out with the paintings *or* the blueprints for the building.

### **TL;DR Version:**
*   **Play the mod?** Yeppers.
*   **Make videos/streams?** Big yep.
*   **Include in a modpack?** Go for it.
*   **Use my hamster images/sounds/code in your own stuff?** Nope. Not without asking first.
*   **Re-upload the mod somewhere else?** Definitely not. Get it from official sources (like Modrinth).
*   **Sell the mod?** The Minecraft EULA says *I* can't even do that, and you shouldn't either.

For the full, legally-binding-but-hopefully-still-understandable text that lawyers apparently enjoy, please see the `LICENSE.md` file included with the mod. If you're thinking of doing something not covered here, just reach out and ask! I'm generally pretty reasonable, unless you try to precisely replace all my hamsters with sentient cabbages. Then we might have words.

### Now go enjoy the squeaks. Or mute them. Whatever.

# Hamsters and whatever.

This repo exists because the **in-game announcement system** still points here.

All actual development, issues, and code live in the 👉🏼👉🏼👉🏼 [**source repo**](https://github.com/DawsonBodenhamer/AdorableHamsterPets-Source) 👈🏼👈🏼👈🏼

# Why two repos?

Once upon a time, this project was closed source.
Reason: a studio whose name starts with the letter 'S' and rhymes with "Parfish Pudios" [openly and seriously floated the idea of stealing my features](https://discord.com/channels/1382334723333820568/1382334724131000395). Yes, really.
That situation cooled off, months passed, nothing happened, and I had more productive things to do than run a Cold War over hamsters.

Later, translation support via Crowdin required the project to be open source to use Crowdin's free plan.
So the code returned to the light, but the assets stayed protected.

The old public repository stuck around because the game’s announcement system still relies on it.

# Licenses

The licenses that actually matter live in the source repo:

- **Code (LGPL-3.0):**  
  https://github.com/DawsonBodenhamer/AdorableHamsterPets-Source/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt

- **Assets (All Rights Reserved):**  
  https://github.com/DawsonBodenhamer/AdorableHamsterPets-Source/blob/develop/ASSETS_LICENSE.txt

### TL;DR

Code: learn from it, fork it, contribute, follow the license.  
Assets: look, don’t take.

That’s it. Now please head over to here:

## What's New in v3.3.0
This is a **mandatory** message for your *current version*. It appears because its `semver` matches your installed version and it hasn't been dismissed yet.

1. Added the new announcement system.
2. Fixed a critical issue with hamster pathfinding.

You can check your local state in the `announcements.json` file.

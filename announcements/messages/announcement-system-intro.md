You've probably noticed the new, slightly jiggly bell icon with hamster ears haunting the corner of your screen. Don't panic. It's a feature. It's my new, fancy way of telling you about updates, announcements, or when I've accidentally replaced all hamster sounds with kazoo solos.

### Here's the deal:
- **The Bell:** It appears when there's something new. It'll wiggle. It wants your attention. Give in.
- **The Click:** Clicking it will either open a message directly or, if you've been ignoring me, open a special section in the Hamster Tips guide book where you can see everything you've missed.
- **The Content:** Messages are fetched from the great cloud repository (GitHub), so you get news without needing to update the mod. Magic.

### You're In Control (Mostly)
Don't like it? Fine. I've given you options because I'm a benevolent developer.
- **Update notifications** can be snoozed via the "Remind Me Later" button. For when 'now' is not a good time.
- **Optional announcements** (like this one, ironically) can be disabled entirely from the message screen itself or re-enabled later in the config menu if you get FOMO.
- The **icon's position, scale, and whether it even shows up** can all be tweaked to your heart's content in the `Announcements & Update Notifications` section of the config.

That's it. You're now an expert on my notification-delivery-hamster-bell-thing. Enjoy the jiggle physics. Or don't. I'm not your boss.

# A Stress Test for Text Rendering
This message is designed to push the boundaries of the markdown renderer, especially with long lines of text that must wrap correctly within the designated content area.

- Here is the first list item, which is intentionally made to be exceptionally long to verify that the text wrapping logic correctly breaks the line and continues rendering on the subsequent line without any **visual glitches** or text being cut off at the edges.

- This second bullet point serves a similar purpose, providing another *very long string of text* that should absolutely wrap onto at least two or three lines, thereby confirming that the height calculation and rendering loop are functioning in harmony.

- Finally, a third list item just to be absolutely certain. This one also includes some `code spans` to ensure that inline formatting doesn't interfere with the line-breaking algorithm, which is a common edge case in simple renderers.

If you can read all of this without any text being clipped on the right side, then the wrapping fix was successful.

# Quick Note on Wonky Tooltips

Due to a minor squabble in the Fzzy Config library (the mod that powers my fancy config screen), the tooltips for the inventory icon offsets are currently on strike. They're supposed to tell you that increasing **'Offset X'** shoves the icon to the **right**, and increasing **'Offset Y'** shoves it **down**.

For now, they're just giving you the silent treatment. I'm waiting on a fix from the Fzzy Config dev. Until then, just remember if you want to shift the announcement bell icon in an inventory GUI: X is sideways, Y is down. You've got this. Happy tweaking

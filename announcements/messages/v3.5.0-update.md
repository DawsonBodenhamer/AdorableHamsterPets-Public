**Your hamsters are currently naked and defenseless.**

Version 3.5.0 adds a massive amount of content focused on progression, protection, and mild deforestation.

### Highlights
*   **Hamster Armor:** From biodegradable Acorn shells to full Netherite plating.
*   **The Tree Heist:** Throw your hamster at an Oak Tree. Watch them raid the canopy for loot.
*   **Progression:** New Smithing Templates, perks for each armor type, and enchantability.
*   **Loot:** Seeds, armor and accessories now spawn in vanilla chests (Dungeons, Villages, Ancient Cities, etc.)
*   Plus literally soooo much more! Too much to cover here.

# Welcome to The Cuteness Overhaul Update!

Congratulations, you’ve upgraded. Your hamsters now have actual beds, configurable Wander Mode, and more leaf-based nonsense than any small mammal truly needs.

Here’s what you can do now:
- **Set Up Hamster HQ:** Craft Hamster Bedding, turn it into Hamster Beds in every wood variant, link tamed hamsters to their beds, and toggle Wander Mode (plus Near/Medium/Far ranges) right from the block.
- **Enjoy the Leaf Circus:** Trigger cozy leaf particles from beds and dispensers, all driven by fancy client-side physics and an indoor/outdoor detection system that takes its job way too seriously.
- **Upgrade Your Yeet Game:** Thrown hamsters now rotate pitch with their flight path, sound better, and broadcast impact audio farther so your targets can be terrified in real time.
- **Tame the Chaos (Mostly):** Biome-configurable color variants, fixed ghost shoulder hamsters, resolved startup crashes, saner world-gen config menus, and smart bed-aware pathfinding make everything feel a bit less cursed.

Enjoy the update, and maybe let your hamster sleep before you throw it repeatedly. For all the nitty-gritty details, (there is much more) you can always view the full [v3.4.0 changelog](https://modrinth.com/mod/adorable-hamster-pets/version/3.4.0-1.21.1+fabric) on Modrinth.

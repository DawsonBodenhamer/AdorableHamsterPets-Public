# The Cuteness Overhaul Update is Here!

Time to update— hamsters just got their own beds, cuter animations, and much more!

Here’s what you’re missing in **v3.4.0**:
- **Hamster Beds & Wander Mode:** Give your tamed hamsters an actual home base with configurable wander ranges, new advancements, and Jade integration so you can see what's what.
- **Weaponized Leaf Aesthetics:** Hamster Bedding explodes into decorative leaf clouds powered by “is this really necessary?” physics, including indoor/outdoor-aware wind gusts.
- **Yeet Glow-Up:** Flying hamsters now have a cuter animation, improved Doppler-ish throw and impact sounds, and a new “incoming” sound so your victims have exactly one second to regret everything.
- **Biome-Smart Hamster Colors:** Variant spawning is now fully configurable per biome and tag, playing nicely with worldgen mods instead of fighting them in the parking lot.
- **Critical Fixes:** Ghost shoulder hamsters, startup crashes from snoozed announcements, and cursed world-gen config weirdness have all been shown the door.

**Adorable Hamster Pets won CurseForge's Mod of the Year 2025!**

Out of 5,000 global nominations, *Adorable Hamster Pets* made the final cut— 15 mods chosen by the jury of top mod devs— and then kept going and actually took the win.
I’m equal parts thrilled and overwhelmed (in the best way). Thank you.

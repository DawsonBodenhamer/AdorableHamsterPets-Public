## Real talk
I don’t normally do the whole “please vote for me” thing, but times have been a bit rough lately— and winning would genuinely help me out with bills *and* let me keep pouring time into updates.

More hamster content I want to keep building:
- **Acorn armor** (tiny. heroic.)
- **New variants** (ancient nether hamsters, ender hamsters)
- **More immersive cheese crafting** (yes, really)
- **Accessories** (because yes)

## A few other ways you can help
- **Spread the word** to friends / servers / fellow rodent appreciators
- **Drop some support** in the comments on [Noxus’ YouTube video](https://youtu.be/W13nCbH776w)
  - Apparently some people think the mod is “too small” to deserve a win, which is… kind of wild. I’m choosing to interpret that as “they haven’t been pelted by a flying hamster yet.” Lol

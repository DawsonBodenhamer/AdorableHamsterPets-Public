# Welcome to v3.3.0: The Patchouli Page-Turner Update

The Hamster Tips guide book got a **Patchouli** makeover with perks: custom UI, auto-upgrades any old book you’re still clutching like a relic, and it also shows virtual entries that launch the new Markdown viewer.

Speaking of the Markdown viewer, a new bell icon with hamster ears (and physics simulated animations) now notifies you of unread update notes, and the Markdown-powered viewer serves them straight from my GitHub without making you alt-tab. The announcements are snoozeable so you can “totally read them later.”

Also, the great **pet ceasefire** is here: I made a new ownership algorithm that stops friendly fire, so thrown hamsters bounce off your own pets instead of starting a tiny civil war.

Also, LOTS more. You can check out the full change log [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/adorable-hamster-pets/version/3.3.0-1.21.1+fabric)!

# Welcome to v3.3.0: The Patchouli Page-Turner Update

That sad little vanilla "Hamster Tips" guide book you used to get? It's been fired. In its place is a glorious, custom-skinned **Patchouli guide book**. It's smarter, looks better, and will automatically find and upgrade any of those ancient relics you have lying around. You're welcome.

### Speaking of new things...
You've probably noticed the new, slightly jiggly **bell icon with hamster ears** haunting the corner of your screen. That's my new, fancy way of telling you about updates without you having to do any actual work. It even has its own physics simulation, because of course it does. Messages are beamed directly from my GitHub, and yes, you can snooze the notifications. Procrastination is a valid life choice.

### The Great Pet Ceasefire of '25
Tired of accidentally committing pet-on-pet violence? The Great Hamster War is officially over. I've implemented a surprisingly sophisticated **friendly-fire prevention algorithm**. Now, when you yeet a hamster, it will bounce harmlessly off your other pets instead of starting a tiny, furry civil war. Your wolves can finally sleep soundly.

There's a bunch of other tweaks and fixes, but this is getting long. If you crave the nitty-gritty details, the full, unabridged changelog awaits your discerning eyes [right here](https://modrinth.com/mod/adorable-hamster-pets/version/3.3.0-1.21.1+fabric).
